The box is special because it has the ability to change gravity. </p><p>There are some columns of toy cubes in the box arranged in a line. The <code>i</code>-th column contains <code>a_i</code> cubes. At first, the gravity in the box is pulling the cubes downwards. When Bob switches the gravity, it begins to pull all the cubes to a certain side of the box, <code>d</code>, which can be either <code>'L'</code> or <code>'R'</code> (left or right). Below is an example of what a box of cubes might look like before and after switching gravity.</p><pre><code>+---+                                       +---+|   |                                       |   |+---+                                       +---++---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---+|   ||   |     |   |   --&gt;        |   ||   ||   |+---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---++---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+|   ||   ||   ||   |         |   ||   ||   ||   |+---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+</code></pre><p>Given the initial configuration of the cubes in the box, find out how many cubes are in each of the <code>n</code> columns after Bob switches the gravity.</p><h3 id="examples-input---output">Examples (input -&gt; output:</h3><pre><code>* 'R', [3, 2, 1, 2]      -&gt;  [1, 2, 2, 3]* 'L', [1, 4, 5, 3, 5 ]  -&gt;  [5, 5, 4, 3, 1]</code></pre>
